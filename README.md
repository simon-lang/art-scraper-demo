# Art Scraper Demo

Currently, cycles through all images in this folder and turns them into ascii art. Once every two seconds.

More functionality to come.

## Install and Run

Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

To install: `npm install`

To run: `node app.js`

## Windows Setup Instructions

Requires better console than cmd.exe. I recommend [cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder) which is based on ConEmu. You may need to right click cmder and choose "Run as Administrator"

Requires python. [Download here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.2/python-3.6.2.exe). *Make sure you tick the box that adds it to your PATH*

Requires Graphics Magick. [Download here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/graphicsmagick/files/graphicsmagick-binaries/1.3.26/GraphicsMagick-1.3.26-Q8-win64-dll.exe/download)

After doing the following, restart cmder (don't forget to run as administrator) then run `npm install`. The app should now work.
